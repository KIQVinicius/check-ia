## :gear: Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need the following tools installed on your machine:
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). 
In addition, you will need to run the [backend](https://github.com/mateusfugita/check-ia-api) and the [ML API](https://github.com/mateusfugita/check-ia-ml) in your machine before continuing.

## :computer: Running locally
1. Install the dependencies

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

2. Run the application

   ```
   yarn start
   ```

3. The application will be running in `localhost:3000`.

## :building_construction: Build the app for production
Running `yarn build`, it builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
